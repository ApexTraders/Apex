STRATEGIZE



Technical Analysis Indicators
Apex provides you with a comprehensive set of Technical Analysis indicators. 9 Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, Stoch, Stoch RSI, CCI, MACD, VWAP

Indicator Detectors
Detectors allow fine grain control of what an indicator should look for to emit a buy or sell signal. Do you want to buy when RSI is now crossing over your oversold threshold?

Multiple Candle Sizes
Each indicator you add to your strategy can be run on a chosen candle size. For example you can run multiple Bollinger Bands over the 30m and 1h candle and have different deviation configuration.

Sell on TA
Apex allows you to use a different set of indicators and configuration to signal sells.

Trailing Stop Loss
Never sell early, Apex will follow price as high as it can and sells when it hits a drop.

Trailing Buy
Much the same to Trailing Stop Loss, Trailing Buy will follow price down before buying on the next significant rise.
